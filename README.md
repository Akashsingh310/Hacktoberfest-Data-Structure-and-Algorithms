# Hacktoberfest-Data-Structure-and-Algorithms
List of data structures and algorithms. Feel free to contribute under Hacktoberfest '19! We've added few suggestions below, that you can implement.

## How To:

0. Register at https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/. 
1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone the forked repository by `git clone https://github.com/{your-username}/Hacktoberfest-Data-Structure-and-Algorithms.git`
3. Code your files in the proper directory according to language.
4. Add the algorithm to README (preferably in alphabetical order) in specified format.
5. Add all your files `git add .`
6. Commit your file changes `git commit -m "Whatever you did here, e.g. created linkedlist class in C++"`
7. Push your changes `git push`
